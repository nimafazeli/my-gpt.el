#+TITLE: my-gpt: Emacs Org-mode Integration for AI Language Models
#+AUTHOR: Nima Fazeli
#+DATE: [2024-05-15 Wed]

* Introduction
  ~my-gpt~ is an Emacs package that integrates AI language models (currently OpenAI's GPT and Perplexity AI) into Org-mode. It allows you to interact with these AI services directly from your Org documents using org-babel code blocks.

* Installation
  1. Ensure you have Emacs 27.1 or later installed.
  2. Place the ~my-gpt.el~ file in your Emacs load path.
  3. Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'my-gpt)
     (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(my-gpt . t))
     (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages)
     #+end_src

  4. Set up your API keys in the =~/.authinfo.gpg= file:

     #+begin_example
     machine api.openai.com login org-ai password YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
     machine api.perplexity.ai login org-ai password YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
     #+end_example

* Basic Usage
  To use ~my-gpt~ in an Org document, create a code block with the ~my-gpt~ language:

  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src my-gpt
  What is the capital of France?
  ,#+end_src
  #+end_src

  Execute the block with ~C-c C-c~, and the AI's response will appear below the block.

* Features and Advanced Usage

** Specifying the AI Service
   Use the ~:service~ header argument to choose between OpenAI and Perplexity:

   #+begin_src my-gpt :service openai
   Describe emacs in one sentence.
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Emacs is a highly customizable, open-source text editor that allows for program editing, email and news reading, and more, primarily used in Unix-like operating systems.




   #+begin_src my-gpt :service perplexity :results output
   What was the closing value of SPY in the past three days? Give me only an org-mode table of the results (without the backtick code guards of gfm).
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : | Date        | Closing Value |
   : |-------------|----------------|
   : | Aug 30, 2024 | 560.77        |
   : | Aug 29, 2024 | 560.31        |
   : | Aug 28, 2024 | 561.21        |




** Setting the AI Model
   Specify the model using the ~:model~ header argument:

   #+begin_src my-gpt :service openai :model gpt-4o
   Write a haiku about vim.
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Vim, swift and precise,
   : In code's realm, you are the guide,
   : Keys dance, thoughts entwined.


   #+begin_src my-gpt :service perplexity :model llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online
   What is the current price of Bitcoin?
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : As of August 30, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is approximately $59,400.06 USD.



   
** Using persistent Sessions
   Use the ~:session~ header argument to maintain context across multiple code blocks:

   #+begin_src my-gpt :service perplexity :session test :results output
   What was the closing value of SPY in the past three days? Give me only an org-mode table of the results in raw format without markdown guards and any other text explanations.
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : | Date       | Closing Value |
   : |------------|---------------|
   : | Aug 30, 2024 | 560.77        |
   : | Aug 29, 2024 | 560.31        |
   : | Aug 28, 2024 | 561.21        |
   : 
   : Note: The closing values are based on the data from Yahoo Finance.


   
   #+begin_src my-gpt :service perplexity :session test :results output
   Give me a link to the chart of the data
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : You can view the chart of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) on various platforms, including:
   : 
   : 1. **TradingView**: A comprehensive platform for financial charts and analysis. The link to SPY's chart is: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/ .
